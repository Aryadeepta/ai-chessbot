# ACM Chess Rules

## Overview
ACM Chess is a variant of traditional chess played on a **6x6 board** with modified rules and piece compositions. Each player starts with:
- **6 Pawns**
- **1 Castle** (Rook) on the far-left side
- **1 Knight** next to the Castle
- **1 Queen** and **1 King** in the center (Queen takes its color)
- **1 Bishop** to the right of the King
- **1 Star** (special piece) on the far-right side

## Objective
The objective of ACM Chess is to **Capture** your opponent’s King while following the modified board and piece movements.
